Hearing I ask | from the holy races,
From Heimdall's sons, | both high and low;
Thou wilt, Valfather, | that well I relate
Old tales I remember | of men long ago.

I remember yet | the giants of yore,
Who gave me bread | in the days gone by;
Nine worlds I knew, | the nine in the tree
With mighty roots | beneath the mold.

Of old was the age | when Ymir lived;
Sea nor cool waves | nor sand there were;
Earth had not been, | nor heaven above,
But a yawning gap, | and grass nowhere.

Then Bur's sons lifted | the level land,
Mithgarth the mighty | there they made;
The sun from the south | warmed the stones of earth,
And green was the ground | with growing leeks.

The sun, the sister | of the moon, from the south
Her right hand cast | over heaven's rim;
No knowledge she had | where her home should be,
The moon knew not | what might was his,
The stars knew not | where their stations were.

Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,
The holy ones, | and council held;
Names then gave they | to noon and twilight,
Morning they named, | and the waning moon,
Night and evening, | the years to number.

At Ithavoll met | the mighty gods,
Shrines and temples | they timbered high;
Forges they set, and | they smithied ore,
Tongs they wrought, | and tools they fashioned.

In their dwellings at peace | they played at tables,
Of gold no lack | did the gods then know,--
Till thither came | up giant-maids three,
Huge of might, | out of Jotunheim.

Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,
The holy ones, | and council held,
To find who should raise | the race of dwarfs
Out of Brimir's blood | and the legs of Blain.

There was Motsognir | the mightiest made
Of all the dwarfs, | and Durin next;
Many a likeness | of men they made,
The dwarfs in the earth, | as Durin said.

Nyi and Nithi, | Northri and Suthri,
Austri and Vestri, | Althjof, Dvalin,
Nar and Nain, | Niping, Dain,
Bifur, Bofur, | Bombur, Nori,
An and Onar, | Ai, Mjothvitnir.

Vigg and Gandalf) | Vindalf, Thrain,
Thekk and Thorin, | Thror, Vit and Lit,
Nyr and Nyrath,-- | now have I told--
Regin and Rathsvith-- | the list aright.

Fili, Kili, | Fundin, Nali,
Heptifili, | Hannar, Sviur,
Frar, Hornbori, | Fræg and Loni,
Aurvang, Jari, | Eikinskjaldi.

The race of the dwarfs | in Dvalin's throng
Down to Lofar | the list must I tell;
The rocks they left, | and through wet lands
They sought a home | in the fields of sand.

There were Draupnir | and Dolgthrasir,
Hor, Haugspori, | Hlevang, Gloin,
Dori, Ori, | Duf, Andvari,
Skirfir, Virfir, | Skafith, Ai.

Alf and Yngvi, | Eikinskjaldi,
Fjalar and Frosti, | Fith and Ginnar;
So for all time | shall the tale be known,
The list of all | the forbears of Lofar.

Then from the throng | did three come forth,
From the home of the gods, | the mighty and gracious;
Two without fate | on the land they found,
Ask and Embla, | empty of might.

Soul they had not, | sense they had not,
Heat nor motion, | nor goodly hue;
Soul gave Othin, | sense gave Hönir,
Heat gave Lothur | and goodly hue.

An ash I know, | Yggdrasil its name,
With water white | is the great tree wet;
Thence come the dews | that fall in the dales,
Green by Urth's well | does it ever grow.

Thence come the maidens | mighty in wisdom,
Three from the dwelling | down 'neath the tree;
Urth is one named, | Verthandi the next,--
On the wood they scored,-- | and Skuld the third.
Laws they made there, and life allotted
To the sons of men, and set their fates.

The war I remember, | the first in the world,
When the gods with spears | had smitten Gollveig,
And in the hall | of Hor had burned her,
Three times burned, | and three times born,
Oft and again, | yet ever she lives.

Heith they named her | who sought their home,
The wide-seeing witch, | in magic wise;
Minds she bewitched | that were moved by her magic,
To evil women | a joy she was.

On the host his spear | did Othin hurl,
Then in the world | did war first come;
The wall that girdled | the gods was broken,
And the field by the warlike | Wanes was trodden.

Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,
The holy ones, | and council held,
Whether the gods | should tribute give,
Or to all alike | should worship belong.

Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,
The holy ones, | and council held,
To find who with venom | the air had filled,
Or had given Oth's bride | to the giants' brood.

In swelling rage | then rose up Thor,--
Seldom he sits | when he such things hears,--
And the oaths were broken, | the words and bonds,
The mighty pledges | between them made.

I know of the horn | of Heimdall, hidden
Under the high-reaching | holy tree;
On it there pours | from Valfather's pledge
A mighty stream: | would you know yet more?

Alone I sat | when the Old One sought me,
The terror of gods, | and gazed in mine eyes:
"What hast thou to ask? | why comest thou hither?
Othin, I know | where thine eye is hidden."
I know where Othin's | eye is hidden,
Deep in the wide-famed | well of Mimir;
Mead from the pledge | of Othin each mom
Does Mimir drink: | would you know yet more?

Necklaces had I | and rings from Heerfather,
Wise was my speech | and my magic wisdom;
Widely I saw | over all the worlds.

On all sides saw I | Valkyries assemble,
Ready to ride | to the ranks of the gods;
Skuld bore the shield, | and Skogul rode next,
Guth, Hild, Gondul, | and Geirskogul.
Of Herjan's maidens | the list have ye heard,
Valkyries ready | to ride o'er the earth.

I saw for Baldr, | the bleeding god,
The son of Othin, | his destiny set:
Famous and fair | in the lofty fields,
Full grown in strength | the mistletoe stood.

From the branch which seemed | so slender and fair
Came a harmful shaft | that Hoth should hurl;
But the brother of Baldr | was born ere long,
And one night old | fought Othin's son.

His hands he washed not, | his hair he combed not,
Till he bore to the bale-blaze | Baldr's foe.
But in Fensalir | did Frigg weep sore
For Valhall's need: | would you know yet more?

Then did Váli slaughter bonds twist:
made farily grim were those fetters of guts.

One did I see | in the wet woods bound,
A lover of ill, | and to Loki like;
By his side does Sigyn | sit, nor is glad
To see her mate: | would you know yet more?

From the east there pours | through poisoned vales
With swords and daggers | the river Slith.

Northward a hall | in Nithavellir
Of gold there rose | for Sindri's race;
And in Okolnir | another stood,
Where the giant Brimir | his beer-hall had.

A hall I saw, | far from the sun,
On Nastrond it stands, | and the doors face north,
Venom drops | through the smoke-vent down,
For around the walls | do serpents wind.

I saw there wading | through rivers wild
Treacherous men | and murderers too,
And workers of ill | with the wives of men;
There Nithhogg sucked | the blood of the slain,
And the wolf tore men; | would you know yet more?

The giantess old | in Ironwood sat,
In the east, and bore | the brood of Fenrir;
Among these one | in monster's guise
Was soon to steal | the sun from the sky.
In silent halls | where runes are carved,
By dwarves in stone | their names preserved,
Legends hidden | in shadows deep,
Of realms once lost | in endless sleep.

The halls of Alviss | gleam with gold,
Riches of earth | and treasures old;
Gems of fire | and silver bright,
Forged in darkness, | far from light.

From depths unknown | rise giants grim,
With frost and stone | on every limb;
The mountains shake | at each dread step,
In Jotunheim | their secrets kept.

Beyond the mists | where mortals stray,
Elves fair and wise | hold hidden sway;
In Alfheim’s woods | they dance by night,
Their laughter soft | like morning light.

The Aesir gather | by morning's haze,
In Asgard’s halls | with Odin’s gaze;
A council called | for things unseen,
For foes yet hid | in shadowed sheen.

A raven calls | to gods and men,
Of wars foreseen | in lands again;
In mighty wings | the omen lies,
Of fate inscribed | in weeping skies.

A spear is raised | in Odin’s hand,
To claim his right | across the land;
In Valhalla’s halls | the fallen feast,
Their glory crowned | in battle ceased.

But Hel awaits | with gates of mist,
For those who fall | by fate’s cold twist;
Her halls are dark, | her throne of bone,
Where silent shades | are left alone.

A tree stands tall | with roots profound,
In soil where ancient | whispers sound;
Yggdrasil’s limbs | hold worlds unseen,
Its branches veiled | in starlit sheen.

The Norns spin threads | from time’s own skein,
Weaving life’s cloth | of joy and pain;
From cradle’s cry | to warrior’s song,
In fated lines | both weak and strong.

And Loki schemes | in shadowed halls,
His laughter cold, | his lies like thralls;
He weaves his trickery | with care,
Deceit and wrath | in silken snare.

Sleipnir runs | with hooves of eight,
Through land and sky, | past time and fate;
Odin rides | to Mimir’s well,
Where ancient waters | secrets tell.

A drink he takes, | a price he pays,
His wisdom grows, | his sight displays;
Yet visions bring | not peace, but dread,
Of fiery ruin | and paths blood-red.

Baldur shines | in Asgard’s light,
Yet doom foretold | awaits his sight;
A shaft of mistletoe | shall fly,
And bring the fairest | low to die.

His mother weeps | by Fensalir,
Her sorrow vast, | her mourning clear;
The world shall grieve | for Baldur’s fall,
For shadows rise | beyond the wall.

Then thunder rolls | and lightning breaks,
As mighty Thor | the heavens shakes;
With Mjolnir high | he smites his foes,
Against the storm | no darkness grows.

The Midgard Serpent | lies below,
In ocean’s depths | where cold winds blow;
But when it stirs, | the waves shall rise,
And drown the world | beneath dark skies.

Frey stands strong | with antlered horn,
With sword laid down | to face the storm;
Yet weaponless, | he meets his fate,
By Surtr’s fire | his doom awaits.

And Freyja rides | with falcon cloak,
Her warriors fierce | in armor soaked;
In battle’s din | her strength revealed,
With love and fury | ever sealed.

When Heimdall blows | his mighty horn,
The end shall come, | the world reborn;
Bifrost shatters | in fiery rain,
A rainbow bridge | undone in pain.

A ship shall sail | from Hel’s dark shore,
With dead who rise | to fight once more;
Naglfar built | from nails of men,
Its sails to guide | by death’s cold hand.

Surtur’s sword | burns bright and high,
A blazing brand | across the sky;
In Muspelheim | his flames do grow,
To scorch the earth | with fiery glow.

The wolves will chase | the sun and moon,
Till swallowed whole | by darkened rune;
The stars shall fade | from heaven’s dome,
As night consumes | all light and home.

Then Vidar stands | by Fenrir’s maw,
With iron shoe | and silent awe;
The wolf shall fall | by godly might,
In vengeance claimed | on fated night.

Vigrid’s plain | with corpses strewn,
As gods and giants | face their doom;
Blood shall stain | the sacred ground,
And thunder’s roar | the only sound.

In silence cold, | the world shall lie,
Beneath a shroud | of ashen sky;
Yet from the dark | a sprout shall rise,
New life to greet | the morning skies.

Through ages vast, | the world returns,
As fire fades | and starlight burns;
Two mortals walk | from hidden grove,
Through dewy grass | and fields they rove.

A dawn anew, | with sun reborn,
A land restored | from battles torn;
Peace shall bloom | where war once raged,
And children dance | where gods engaged.

Though tales are told | of gods and strife,
Of ancient days | and mortal life;
Their names remain | in whispered lore,
Remembered now, | forevermore.

With hearts of stone | and eyes of flame,
We honor all | who bore the name;
For even gods | in time must fade,
But legends live | in realms they made.

Then silence falls | as words do cease,
And Yggdrasil sways | in gentle peace;
The runes grow still, | the fates unwind,
And all shall rest | till stars align.

Enduring song | of time and death,
In every breath | and shadowed depth;
For ages come, | the wheel shall turn,
In fire and frost | the world shall burn.

And from the ashes, | life shall find
A path reborn, | by fate defined;
As moon and sun | shall rise again,
To mark the tales | of gods and men.

In halls of stone | and caverns deep,
Where shadows coil | and secrets sleep,
The dwarves still toil | with skill untold,
Forging wonders | of iron and gold.

Beneath the hills | in fire’s light,
They hammer steel | in endless night;
Rings of power, | and armor bright,
Weapons sharp | for gods’ own might.

The Völva sees | through mists and veils,
In runes she reads | the hidden tales;
The web of wyrd | she weaves and ties,
In tangled paths | the future lies.

Of things unseen, | of fates entwined,
Of gods’ lost kin, | and mortals blind;
In shadows cast | by stars and sun,
The fated doom | shall come undone.

Now Thor descends | where giants dwell,
In icebound caves, | through storm and spell;
With Mjolnir raised | he crushes foes,
In thunder’s roar | his power shows.

Great rivers flow | from Jotunheim,
In torrents cold | from peaks they climb;
The blood of giants, | ice and stone,
Shall drown the fields | where crops were sown.

The winds shall howl | across the seas,
As ships embark | on fated lees;
With swords held high | and shields of oak,
Their vows shall end | in battle’s smoke.

Now Njord stands firm | by sea and shore,
The lord of waves, | the tempest’s roar;
The winds obey | his ancient song,
To guide the ships | that sail along.

And Skadi hunts | on mountain crest,
With silver bow | and spear abreast;
The snow her cloak, | the ice her throne,
The wilds her realm, | the wind her own.

In realms unseen | where shadows play,
Loki broods | in darkened fray;
Bound by chains | in endless night,
His fury waits | till stars ignite.

Sigyn weeps | by Loki’s side,
In sorrow bound | as husband’s bride;
With hands she shields | from serpent’s sting,
Yet fate decrees | his suffering.

When Ragnarök | in fire is born,
The earth shall quake | in mist and morn;
Mountains crumble, | rivers dry,
And wolves devour | the stars on high.

The skies shall split | in crimson blaze,
As Surtr wields | his sword to raze;
In Muspel’s fire | the world’s end lies,
As flames devour | the weeping skies.

Frey shall stand | with horn in hand,
Against the fire | and shadowed band;
Yet blade he lacks, | and life shall wane,
In muspel’s wrath | his strength is slain.

The wolf shall feast | on gods and men,
With blood-stained maw | in Vigrid’s glen;
Fenrir’s rage | shall know no bound,
Till earth is torn | and heavens drowned.

Yet Vidar waits | in silent ire,
With iron heel | and heart of fire;
To slay the beast | his strength shall rise,
And Fenrir fall | ’neath vengeful skies.

The serpent coils | from ocean deep,
Its venom flows | in rivers steep;
Jormungand’s might | shall crush the land,
Till gods and men | are dust and sand.

Then Thor shall fight | the serpent vast,
In battle fierce | till breath be last;
With Mjolnir’s blow | the beast shall fall,
Yet Thor himself | shall perish, all.

The sun turns black, | the stars shall fade,
As night consumes | the light displayed;
The earth sinks low, | the seas rise high,
In darkness deep | all creatures lie.

From Niflheim’s gate | the dead shall pour,
To march in ranks | on shadowed shore;
Hela’s horde, | with eyes so cold,
In iron chains | their fate foretold.

The Gjallarhorn | sounds one last call,
As gods and men | before it fall;
The worlds shall end, | yet silence stays,
Until new dawn | restores the days.

From ash and ruin, | life anew,
A world reborn | in morning dew;
Two shall walk | the fields once more,
As gods and giants | are seen no more.

Upon the heights | the eagles soar,
While trees grow green | as they did before;
The rivers flow, | the skies are clear,
In lands untouched | by death or fear.

The sons of men | shall rise again,
And tales shall tell | of might and pain;
Of battles won | and fates aligned,
In wisdom gained | and peace defined.

Through ages vast | the tree shall grow,
With roots in earth | and boughs below;
In Yggdrasil’s heart | the secrets lie,
Of worlds renewed | ’neath open sky.

And still in song | the stories live,
Of gods who took | and gods who give;
In every heart | the tales remain,
Of honor, loss, | and love’s sweet pain.

Thus ends the saga, | the cycle done,
Of frost and fire, | of moon and sun;
For fate is bound | to life’s own flow,
And all must reap | what once did sow.
